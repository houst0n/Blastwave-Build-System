/*-
 * This code is derived from section 17.1 of Applied Cryptography,
 * second edition, which describes a stream cipher allegedly
 * compatible with RSA Labs "RC4" cipher (the actual description of
 * which is a trade secret).  The same algorithm is used as a stream
 * cipher called "arcfour" in Tatu Ylonen's ssh package.
 *
 * Here the stream cipher has been modified always to include the time
 * when initializing the state.  That makes it impossible to
 * regenerate the same random sequence twice, so this can't be used
 * for encryption, but will generate good random numbers.
 *
 * RC4 is a registered trademark of RSA Laboratories.
