 The GGZ Gaming Zone is a standards-conforming online gaming infrastructure
 which provides many applications and games to people who like to play
 on the internet or in local networks.

 Users will most likely want to connect to a GGZ server on the internet,

-\fICore clients\fR are used to perform this task. Functional clients exist

-and \fBggz-gtk\fR for GNOME or XFCE users, and \fBggz-txt\fR for people who

 .SH "GAMES"
 .LP
 Games are usually launched by the GGZ server, with corresponding game clients
 running on the user's desktop. Plenty of games are available for GGZ, most
 of them coming from the GGZ project itself but several independent game projects
 do now provide GGZ support.
-Game clients are implemented using multiple toolkits, some of which stem from
-certain desktop environments. However, all games work equally well under all
-desktops, it's just a matter of personal choice which of them are to be
-installed - having all of them is just fine.
 .LP
 While some GGZ game clients are suited for online gaming only, others also run
 locally like normal games happen to do. Those will be found in the desktop's
 application menu.
