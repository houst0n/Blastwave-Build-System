Hi there.

To get started, first you need to obtain the fantastic pkgbuild software from the ever talanted laszlo.

Get it here: http://pkgbuild.sourceforge.net/

Next, you want bootstrap it into /opt/blast as follows:

-bash-3.2$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/blast
-bash-3.2$ gmake
-bash-3.2$ gmake install

Next, you need the SUN Studio Compilers, currently supported version is 12.3 - grab them from oracle.com
